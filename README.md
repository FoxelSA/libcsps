## libcsps<br />Crossed-signal positioning system library

The libcsps library, for crossed signal positioning system library, is designed to determine position and orientation of camera devices builded with inertial and absolute measurement units such as GPS and IMU. It is designed to consider the multiple sensor signals provided by the device assembly and to cross them in order to obtain the best positions and orientations of the camera in time and in three-dimensional space.
